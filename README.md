# Application Tracker

For anyone who has applied to hundreds of different job positions and internships, we all understand how difficult it can be to keep track of every single application that we have filled out and every single company we have applied for. Over time, we forget which companies we have heard back from, which haven't given a response, and if so, where in the hiring process is a certain individual. <br/>

The Application Tracker will allow the user to keep track of all their job applications that have been completed. Furthermore, there are instances when job applications take a significant amount of time and can not be completed on time. The Application Tracker will allow the user to hold job applications they have been interested in or have started filling out, but have not yet completed.


In this project, The Application Tracker utilizes Kivy, a Python framework that allows for the creation of Graphical User Interfaces. In the Application Tracker, the app utilizes features such as Float Layout, Box Layout, Scroll View, and Buttons & Labels. In addition, in order to store the user information for future retrival, I designed a relational database using a library in Python called SQLite3. This allows the user to see all the applications they have applied for and delete specific entries which are no longer necessary.
