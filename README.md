# Application Tracker

For anyone who has applied to hundreds of different job positions and internships, we all understand how difficult it can be to keep track of every single application that we have filled out and every single company we have applied for. Over time, we forget which companies we have heard back from, which haven't given a response, and if so, where in the hiring process is a certain individual. <br/>

Currently, I am desiging an app using Python and Kivy that will allow users to enter information such as: job position, company, application filed date, interview status, and job status so users can keep track of their application process for each position they have applied for.
